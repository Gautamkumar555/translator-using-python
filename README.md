This Python code provides a simple translation tool that converts English words into Hindi using the `GoogleTranslator` from the `deep-translator` library. The program continuously prompts the user to enter English words and outputs their Hindi meanings. It gracefully handles errors during translation and allows the user to exit by typing "exit."
